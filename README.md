This example demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to functions returning Null values. VBScript's type system is quite flexible, and the implicit conversion between Null and other data types can cause unexpected behavior.  This issue usually surfaces when a function intended to return a string (or any other data type) returns Null.  The calling code might not anticipate this and attempt to use the Null value in a way that is not compatible with its expected type, leading to runtime errors.
